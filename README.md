üß† How It Works

The Smart Proctoring System operates by continuously monitoring the video and audio feed of the test-taker.
OpenCV captures the video input, where MediaPipe processes the frames to detect and track the examinee's head movements.
Simultaneously, the audio input is analyzed using the sounddevice library to detect any unauthorized speech or ambient noise. 
Machine learning algorithms enhance the system's accuracy by providing reliable head pose estimation and speech recognition.
